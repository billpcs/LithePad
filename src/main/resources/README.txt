LithePad: A simple, small and portable notepad

Some Tips:
-- The keyboard shortcuts can be seen in the menus.
-- Use -h or --help in the command line to see what happens

Some Info:
-- It is a very simple notepad/text-editor developed with Scala and Swing library
-- It is not being developed professionally, meaning it can fall short in many aspects
-- It is cross-platform since it is just a jar file
-- The code style may be horrendous for somebody with experience in programming

What I had in mind when I started was to learn programming and various techniques
through a hands-on project like this. Later, I started to imagine a small portable
notepad/text-editor that you could have in your usb and use wherever you go.

Of course there are much much better portable editors out there. But this one is mine (and stevepapazis's)
